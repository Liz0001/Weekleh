# WEEKLEH
============


Currently waiting to continue, due to school


Hi, it's Liis.
Weekleh is a (test) app that I'm trying to create based on the knowledge from Agile course.




## About

Weekleh is your weekly to-do list,
where you log in, add your weekly to do item.
So, you add an activity, such as 'Running' and times: '3'.
Then you can tick off that item, and the amount per week will decrease by 1.
Left is only 'Running: 2'.
Well, let us see if we can actually make it happen.
